## 📖 Core Hooks

Applestack provides powerful React hooks built on Applesauce:

### Event Management
- **`use$`**: Subscribe to RxJS observables with automatic cleanup
- **`useEventStore`**: Access the global EventStore instance
- **`useTimeline`**: Subscribe to live event timelines from relays
- **`useLocalTimeline`**: Query events from local EventStore only

### User & Authentication
- **`useAccount`**: Get the currently logged-in account
- **`useUser`**: Create a User cast with reactive profile and contacts
- **`useProfile`**: Get user profile metadata (uses User cast internally)
- **`useMyUser`**: Get current user's User cast
- **`useLoginActions`**: Access login methods (extension, nsec, bunker)

### Publishing & Actions
- **`usePublish`**: Publish events with automatic signing
- **`useAction`**: Execute pre-built actions (CreateNote, FollowUser, etc.)

### Utilities
- **`useTheme`**: Theme management (light/dark mode)
- **`useToast`**: Toast notifications
- **`useIsMobile`**: Responsive design helper
- **`useLocalStorage`**: Persistent local storage

## 🎨 UI Components

MKStack includes 48+ shadcn/ui components:

**Layout**: Card, Separator, Sheet, Sidebar, ScrollArea, Resizable
**Navigation**: Breadcrumb, NavigationMenu, Menubar, Tabs, Pagination
**Forms**: Button, Input, Textarea, Select, Checkbox, RadioGroup, Switch, Slider
**Feedback**: Alert, AlertDialog, Toast, Progress, Skeleton
**Overlay**: Dialog, Popover, HoverCard, Tooltip, ContextMenu, DropdownMenu
**Data Display**: Table, Avatar, Badge, Calendar, Chart, Carousel
**And many more...

## 🔐 Security & Best Practices

- **Never use `any` type**: Always use proper TypeScript types
- **Event validation**: Filter events through validator functions for custom kinds
- **Efficient queries**: Minimize separate queries to avoid rate limiting
- **Proper error handling**: Graceful handling of invalid NIP-19 identifiers
- **Secure authentication**: Use signer interface, never request private keys directly

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Mobile-first approach with Tailwind breakpoints
- `useIsMobile` hook for responsive behavior
- Touch-friendly interactions
- Optimized for all screen sizes

## 🧪 Testing

- Vitest with jsdom environment
- React Testing Library with jest-dom matchers
- `TestApp` component provides all necessary context providers
- Mocked browser APIs (matchMedia, scrollTo, IntersectionObserver, ResizeObserver)
